c    common block bandta contains random band parameters for the LW 
c    calculations using 10 cm-1 wide bands. The 15 um CO2 complex
c    is 2 bands,560-670 and 670-800 cm-1. Ozone coefficients are
c    in 3 bands,670-800 (14.1 um),990-1070 and 1070-1200 (9.6 um).
c    The  (nblw) bands now include: 
c                56 bands, 10  cm-1 wide    0  -   560  cm-1
c                 2 bands, 15 um complex  560  -   670  cm-1
c                                         670  -   800  cm-1
c                 3 "continuum" bands     800  -   900  cm-1
c                                         900  -   990  cm-1
c                                        1070  -   1200 cm-1
c                 1 band for 9.6 um band  990  -   1070 cm-1
c               100 bands, 10 cm-1 wide  1200  -   2200 cm-1
c                 1 band for 4.3 um src  2270  -   2380 cm-1
c    Thus nblw presently equals    163

c    2) the continuum coefficient for the 800-990,1070-1200 cm-1 band
