Dinghushan (metDH) now has isoil=2 (instead of 8) since 2 Jul 2008.

*********************************************************
Files in this directory are for validation of CABLE by internal group members.

The met files for Hyytiala, Little Washita, Metolius, Walker Branch and Weiden
Brunnen were reprocessed by Gab in late October 2007. 
The met files for Bondville (metBV9?), Dinghushan (metDH), Harvard Forest 
(metHV), Tharandt (metTH) and Tumbarumba were processed by BP in September and 
early October 2007. Most of them have observed LAI.

Important note: (1) All these are still using CASA vegetation type!
                    New data files *_igbp.nc are generated by first renaming
                    the variable and then appending the new info using NCO
                    utilities on Cherax:
                      ncrename -v iveg,CASA metDH.nc metDH_igbp.nc
                      vi addIveg.cdl   (cp dim and att from original file)
                      ncgen -o append.nc addIveg.cdl
                      ncks -v iveg -c -h -F append.nc metDH_igbp.nc (choose a
                                               for append when being prompted)
                    Note that Bondville does not need changes as cropland
                    is type 12 in both CASA and IGBP. They are therefore renamed
                    using a soft link.
                (2) Hyytiala does not have observed Rnet
                    requiring modification to R scripts.
                (3) Little Washita will have extremme ground heat fluxes
                    during simulation; only way to get results is to
                    turn off range_checking.
                (4) Tumbarumba has data gaps for heat and NEE fluxes in mid 2004
                    requiring modification to R scripts.
