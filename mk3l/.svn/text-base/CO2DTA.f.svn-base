c   The following common blocks contain pretabulated Co2 transmission 
c   functions, evaluated using the methods of Fel and
c   Schwarzkopf (1981) and Schwarzkopf and Fels (1985), 
c***Common co2bd3 contains Co2 transmission functions and temperature 
c   and pressure derivatives for the 560-800 cm-1 band. Also included 
c   are the standard temperatures and the weighting function. These 
c   data are in block data bd3:
